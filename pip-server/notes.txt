TODO:
Add grafana dashboarding using spring ai observability? https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/observability/index.html

FINDINGS:
System calls overwrite the default system

the nano-id guy has the github.com/ai url 0o

using ktor client is more trouble than it was worth (alot of config needed, and it seems to trim spaces from SSE)

I started with streaming endpoints, but i found myself waiting for the complete answer anyway so simplified to non streaming

LLMs kinda break when u ask them to do things with backticks (`)
