Run graph server -> npx vite (in the correct folder)
Run embedding server (in the correct folder) ->
 1. .\Scripts\activate
 2. fastapi dev .\embeddingServer.py

TODO:
Add grafana dashboarding using spring ai observability? https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/observability/index.html

FINDINGS:
System calls overwrite the default system

the nano-id guy has the github.com/ai url 0o

using ktor client is more trouble than it was worth (alot of config needed, and it seems to trim spaces from SSE)

I started with streaming endpoints, but i found myself waiting for the complete answer anyway so simplified to non streaming

LLMs kinda break when u ask them to do things with backticks (`)

fine tuning the model turned to be more destructive than i wanted.

GraalPy + ML packages + windows = bad time

"org.openrewrite.config.RecipeIntrospectionException: Kotlin recipes must be instantiated using Jackson ?!?!?!?!?!?

OLLAMA chat client can't handle <think></think> tags for structured output :(

We need to disable banner and console logging for STDIO transport to work for the mcp server?

THINGS TO EXPLAIN:
NO INTERACTION EMBEDDINGS VS FULL INTERACTION VS NO INTERACTION
SINGLE VECTOR VS MULTI VECTOR EMBEDDINGS
<THINK> </THINK> tags break spring ai (and langchain4j?). Have to parse manually anyway
GOD LLMS SUCK AT PICKING THINGS AT RANDOM
MAYBE TURN MEME'S ON AND OFF LIVE TO SHOW HOW TRIGGER HAPPY THE LLM GETS

STUFF THAT CAN GO WRONG:
- LLM Gives wrong structured responses
- OLLAMA crashes
- Fighting to get random responses, sometimes its easier to just do the random part urself.
